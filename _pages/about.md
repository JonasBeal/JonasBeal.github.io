I am a PhD student working in Institut Curie. I'm interested in how we can model the molecular mechanisms of cancer in order to predict what happens to patients and especially what is the most appropriate treatment.

This work is therefore primarily systems biology (supervised by [Emmanuel Barillot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DlbKc_sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Laurence Calzone](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AHRGDycAAAAJ) in [Sysbio team](https://sysbio.curie.fr)) in that it requires the construction of models of cancer mechanisms that need to be personalised and adapted to the characteristics of patients by integrating their biological data.
However, quantifying the impact of these models and their clinical contribution calls for specific methods that place this work at the interface with biostatistics (supervised by [Aur√©lien Latouche](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=mcAjtF0AAAAJ) in [STAMPM team](https://science.institut-curie.org/research/integrated-biology/bioinformatics-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-computational-systems-biology-of-cancer/clinical-biostatistics/))
